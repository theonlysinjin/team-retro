# Sprint Retro Tool - Project Summary

## What Was Built

A fully functional, peer-to-peer sprint retrospective web application with:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **P2P Architecture**
   - WebRTC-based peer-to-peer connections via PeerJS
   - No backend required - all data stays in browsers
   - Host acts as authoritative source
   - Real-time state synchronization

2. **Session Management**
   - Create new sessions (host)
   - Join via session code or link
   - Automatic session code generation
   - Copy shareable link functionality

3. **Canvas-Based Board**
   - Infinite canvas for free-form card placement
   - Drag and drop cards anywhere
   - Pan by clicking and dragging background
   - Zoom in/out with Ctrl+scroll or zoom controls
   - Modern, clean UI inspired by Excalidraw

4. **Card Features**
   - Create cards with optional categories (What Went Well, What Went Badly, TODO)
   - Edit card content inline
   - Choose from 8 professional colors
   - User attribution (shows who created each card)
   - Delete cards
   - Smooth animations with framer-motion

5. **Voting System**
   - +1 voting on any card
   - Vote count displayed on card
   - Toggle votes on/off
   - Prevents duplicate votes per user

6. **Save/Load**
   - Export session to JSON file
   - Load previous session from JSON
   - All cards, votes, and positions preserved

7. **User Management**
   - Name entry on landing page
   - Name persistence in localStorage
   - No authentication (ready for future auth)

### 🏗️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo (targeting Web)
- **Routing**: Expo Router
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **P2P**: PeerJS (WebRTC)
- **Drag & Drop**: react-draggable
- **Animations**: framer-motion
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

### 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with subtle shadows and smooth colors
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablet browsers
- **Accessible**: Clear visual hierarchy and readable fonts
- **Performant**: Optimistic updates, efficient re-renders
- **Intuitive**: Drag handles, hover states, visual feedback

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No Server Storage**: All data lives in participant browsers
- **Encrypted Connections**: WebRTC uses DTLS encryption
- **Temporary Sessions**: Data cleared when all peers disconnect
- **User Control**: Save/load functionality gives users control
- **Trust-Based**: Currently no auth, suitable for trusted teams

### ⚙️ Configuration Files

- **package.json**: Dependencies and scripts
- **app.json**: Expo configuration
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration
- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: Automated deployment

### 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

1. **Initialize Git**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Create new repo on GitHub
   - Push your code

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions

4. **Access Your App**:
   - Wait for first deployment (check Actions tab)
   - Visit: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

### 🧪 Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start development server
npm start

# In browser, press 'w' to open web view

# Create a session and test features:
# - Create cards
# - Drag cards around
# - Vote on cards
# - Change card colors
# - Save/load session
```

2. **No Persistence**: Data lost when all peers disconnect (use Save feature)
3. **Scale Limit**: Best for 2-20 participants
4. **Browser Only**: Requires modern browser with WebRTC support
5. **Network Sensitive**: Poor connections affect all participants

### 📚 Documentation

- **README.md**: User guide and getting started
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- **SUMMARY.md**: This overview document

### 💡 Usage Tips

1. **For Best Experience**:
   - Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
   - Ensure good internet connection
   - Host should stay connected throughout session

2. **For Teams**:
   - Create session before team meeting
   - Share link via Slack/Teams/Email
   - Use Save feature to preserve retrospective
   - Export and archive important sessions

3. **For Privacy**:
   - Data never touches a server
   - Use in trusted environments
   - Consider future auth for sensitive data
   - Save important sessions locally

### 🎯 Success Metrics
