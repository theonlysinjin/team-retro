# What's New - Latest Updates

## ✨ Major Improvements

### 1. 🔑 Host Token System
**Problem**: Host couldn't reconnect as host if they refreshed
**Solution**:
- Host gets special URL with secret token: `/session/ABC123?h=token`
- Host can reconnect with ANY name
- Token is private - only share regular link with team
- Regular link: `/session/ABC123` (for team members)

**How to use:**
- Click "🔑 Host Link" button to copy YOUR special link
- Click "📋 Copy Link" to share with team (regular link)

### 2. 🎨 Free-Form Canvas
**Changed**: From strict columns to free-form placement
**New features:**
- Drop cards **anywhere** on the canvas
- **Visual lane guides** in background (not strict)
- **Double-click anywhere** to create card at that position
- **Pan** by dragging empty space
- **Zoom** with Ctrl+Scroll

### 3. 🖱️ Double-Click Card Creation
- Double-click anywhere on canvas
- Creates card at mouse position
- Default yellow color
- Edit content by clicking card

### 4. 🎨 Color Picker in Add Card
- Choose color when creating card (no longer just yellow!)
- 8 professional colors to choose from
- Preview before creating

### 5. 👥 Voter Names on Hover
- Hover over 👍 button
- See **exactly who voted**
- Dark tooltip with all voter names

### 6. 📦 Card Grouping (Basic)
**Status**: Detection implemented
- Drop card within 50px of another card
- Cards snap together
- Ready for grouping animation (TODO)

### 7. 🎯 Better UX
- Cards placed top-right when using "Add Card" button (visible but out of way)
- No category required (lanes are just visual guides)
- Cleaner, Material Design styling
- Smoother animations with @dnd-kit
